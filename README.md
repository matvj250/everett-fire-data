# everett-fire-data

This was my project idea in my senior year data science capstone. My group and I ended up not going with it, so I decided to go through with it on my own time to get some more personal experience. I ended up working in Pandas, SQL, and Vega Lite. In all honesty, there were no real takeaways from the data, so it was a good thing it didn't end up being the capstone project, but it was still good experience.
